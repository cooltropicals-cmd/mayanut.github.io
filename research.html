  <h1>Research</h1>
  <p>The mayanut, <em>Brosimum alicastrum</em>, is a tropical rainforest tree in the jackfruit family, Moraceae, which includes more commonly known fruit trees like figs and mulberries. Trees are capable of reaching heights of more than 35 m in Central America where the tree is prized, however the tree’s height will vary mainly on how much water it receives. A drought tolerant species, but still loves water, trees usually get about 20 m tall in drier regions. Mayanut trees produce thousands of red fruit which taste like syrupy-sweet figs, and under the thin chewy, fruity layer, there is a seed, which has been most valued by ancient civilizations like the Mayans, whom the tree is named after. Maya nut is indigenous to regions spanning southern Mexico to northern South America. Historically, its seeds have been a staple in the diets of indigenous communities, valued for their nutritional content and versatility. In recent years, there has been a resurgence of interest in cultivating this tree for its potential to contribute to food security, economic development, and sustainable agriculture.</p>

  <p>Cultivating <em>B. alicastrum</em> on a commercial scale offers several economic benefits. The seeds can be processed into flour for food products, like Cereals, Granolas, Baked Goods, Drinks, and so much more, while the wood can be utilized in construction and in furniture making. Additionally, the tree’s leaves can serve as forage and fodder for livestock, which is what ranchers in its native habitat rely on to feed their cattle in the dry season as the grasses dry up, but the deep taproot of the Maya nut tree is able to access the water table deep under the soil. <em>B. alicastrum</em> trees are well-suited to agroforestry systems, providing shade and improving soil fertility. Their deep, hurricane-resistant root systems also help in water retention and soil stabilization, making them beneficial in reforestation and land restoration projects.</p>

  <p>Maya nut presents a multifaceted opportunity for sustainable development. Its seeds offer a rich nutritional profile, and its wood provides valuable material for various industries. The tree’s adaptability and resilience to drought and full-shade to full-sun, make it a promising candidate for agroforestry systems, contributing to food security, environmental sustainability, and economic development in American Agriculture.</p>
