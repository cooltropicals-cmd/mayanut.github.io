      <h1>About The MayaNut Company</h1>

      <p>The MayaNut Company was started in 2025 and is growing <em>Brosimum alicastrum</em> trees in South Florida. The mayanut tree is an ancient tropical rainforest species, unknown to American agriculture. In the Yucatán, many mayanut trees are found around ancient Mayan sites. The trees produce edible seeds, perfect for our future products. Our mission is to save <em>Brosimum alicastrum</em> from extinction by bringing it into sustainable agriculture.</p>

      <h2>The Vision of August Kokus</h2>

      <p>August Kokus always had the fascination of creating something. He first learned about <em>Brosimum alicastrum</em> in 2022 and founded The MayaNut Company in 2025. He often questioned why he is conscious in his body, “sitting behind his eyes.” His goal was to leave behind proof of his existence — he valued his perspective so much — in the form of something that could adapt to an ever-changing world and never die. His love for music like Rachmaninoff, Tchaikovsky, and Scriabin inspired him.</p>

      <p>Plants can heal if injured, evolve with a changing world, and provide a service to humanity. When humans are eventually forced to leave Earth as the sun expands, people will take what they need to survive — the cows, the chickens, the wheat, the mayanut — but certainly not the mosquito.</p>

      <p>In 2027, his creation became the first mayanut plantation in South Florida, launching a new agricultural industry. By 2029, mayanut was a popular “superfood” and seen as incredibly valuable. In 2033 on the optimistic horizon of progress, Mr. Kokus led his company to become a lifeline to malnourished countries, as mayanut became the 11th most popular crop in the U.S. <em>Brosimum alicastrum</em> was considered extremely valuable, finally gaining the recognition it deserves.</p>

      <p>By 2039, The MayaNut Company became one of the world’s newest leaders in agriculture. In 2055, the company amassed a total of 1 million hectares of tropical and subtropical land. By 2061, The MayaNut Company had plantations in India, Africa, Asia, Australia, South America, and Florida — eventually replacing the Florida Orange as Florida’s primary agricultural income.</p>

      <p>In 2063, August Kokus’s net worth reached $1 trillion, and he dedicated his wealth to establishing mayanut plantations across the world. He was a genius, obsessed with the perfection of his creation. In 2066, the first <em>Brosimum alicastrum</em> seeds germinated on Mars for study. By 2077, large-scale farming of <em>B. alicastrum</em> on Mars began. In 2089, mayanut continued to provide 11 billion humans with food.</p>

      <p>On December 2, 2101, August Kokus passed away, leaving behind a creation so vast that by 2242, communities around the world relied on mayanut as a primary source of food. Through domestication, seeds grew to two inches in diameter with improved taste — all because of one man’s contribution to humanity. He said: “I am lucky to be born in the 21st century; discovery is dwindling — but through my plants, my beauty, my creation, I will reach into the future for centuries. There it is: perfection.”</p>
