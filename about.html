  ❄️ The MayaNut Company Wishes You a Very Merry Christmas 2025 ❄️

  <p>The MayaNut Company was founded in 2025 by August Kokus, who wanted to leave behind something new and meaningful — a living legacy that would adapt, evolve, and bring value to people long after he was gone. That legacy became the MayaNut project.</p>

  <p>Brosimum alicastrum, known as the Maya nut tree, is native to South Florida’s extended tropical region, stretching across Cuba, Jamaica, Mexico, Central America, and into northern Colombia and Venezuela. Its story with humans began nearly 20,000 years ago, when the first early settlers of the Americas encountered it. Indigenous peoples — including the Maya — used the tree for food, shade, and survival, and it became woven into Mesoamerican culture.</p>

  <p>At The MayaNut Company, we are working to establish South Florida’s first MayaNut plantation, developing new uses for this nutritious seed. The Maya nut can be roasted, ground, brewed like coffee, or made into a creamy drink — all without caffeine. We aim to bring it into modern agriculture responsibly and sustainably.</p>

  <p>Future products will include ground MayaNut for a coffee-like beverage and ready-to-drink bottled MayaNut beverages, planned for release in grocery stores by 2028.</p>
