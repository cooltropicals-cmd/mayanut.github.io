  <h1>About MayaNut™</h1>
  <p>August Kokus is the founder of MayaNut™. Our goal is to bring the mayanut to South Florida agriculture and conserve this lucrative species. Mayanut, <em>Brosimum alicastrum</em>, is a species of tree most notably valued for its nutritious seed. Trees grow primarily in Mexico, on the Yucatan Peninsula, but its range extends as far north as Tamaulipas and Sinaloa, and as far south into Brazil, Cuba, and Jamaica. It has also been recently introduced to Florida. Trees can reach 35 meters tall and, as long-lived perennials, they can remain productive for 130 years and live beyond 200 years of age.</p>
  <p>Also known as breadnut (not to be confused with breadfruit), or in Central America most commonly referred to as Ojoche, Ramón, or Guaimaro, this tropical rainforest tree belongs to the jackfruit family, Moraceae, which also includes more commonly known fruit trees such as figs and mulberries. Trees are capable of reaching heights of more than 35 meters in Central America where the tree is prized, although the height will vary depending mainly on water availability. A drought-tolerant species that still loves water, trees usually reach about 20 meters in drier regions. Mayanut trees produce thousands of red fruit that taste like syrupy-sweet figs, and under the thin, chewy, fruity layer lies a seed that has been most valued by ancient civilizations such as the Mayans, from whom the tree takes its name.</p>
  <p>Maya nut is indigenous to regions spanning southern Mexico to northern South America. Historically, its seeds have been a staple in the diets of indigenous communities, valued for their nutritional content and versatility. In recent years, there has been renewed interest in cultivating this tree for its potential to contribute to food security, economic development, and sustainable agriculture.</p>
  <p>Cultivating <em>Brosimum alicastrum</em> on a commercial scale offers several economic benefits. The seeds can be processed into flour for food products such as cereals, granolas, baked goods, and drinks, while the wood can be utilized in construction and furniture making. Additionally, the tree’s leaves can serve as forage and fodder for livestock, which ranchers in its native habitat rely on to feed their cattle during the dry season when grasses dry up. The deep taproot of the Maya nut tree is able to access the water table deep under the soil.</p>
  <p><em>Brosimum alicastrum</em> trees are well-suited to agroforestry systems, providing shade and improving soil fertility. Their deep, hurricane-resistant root systems also help in water retention and soil stabilization, making them beneficial in reforestation and land restoration projects.</p>
  <p>Maya nut presents a multifaceted opportunity for sustainable development. Its seeds offer a rich nutritional profile, and its wood provides valuable material for various industries. The tree’s adaptability and resilience to drought and full-shade to full-sun make it a promising candidate for agroforestry systems, contributing to food security, environmental sustainability, and economic development in American agriculture.</p>
